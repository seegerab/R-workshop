# Week 1

This week, you will be installing R and RStudio.

If you already have R and RStudio installed, there is nothing you need to do! If you would like, you can investigate some of the resources outlined on the main page. 

## Steps

### **Install R**  

1. Click here to start: [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).

2. Select either "Download R for Windows" or "Download R for macOS" depending on your operating system. 

Moving forward, the screenshots will be for the Windows installation. However, the steps will be the same for the Mac installation.
