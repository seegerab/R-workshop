# Week 2

This week, you will learn how to read in data, about different data types, and how to calculate basic summary statistics. For all links, it may be easiest to right-click and open in new tab.

1. Watch <a href="https://youtu.be/VUrHP0HPWjc" target="_blank">this video</a>  
2. Download the data that Abigail shared as an attachment in the Week 2 email. 
3. Complete <a href="https://github.com/seegerab/R-workshop/blob/main/PreWorkshop/Week2/Week2.Rmd" target="_blank">Week2.Rmd</a>

When you first open the .Rmd, you will likely see a prompt at the top to install "tidyverse" and "tableone". You may click "Install", or wait until we learn about these packages further down in the .Rmd and install then. 

4. Fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFl47GV0cpqrnyWu-l2evzrMRAyC2K8T_SRwfNPBf2koswfA/viewform" target="_blank">this survey</a>  

5. Celebrate! You completed everything for week 2.
