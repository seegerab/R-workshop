# Week 3

This is the final assignment before we meet in person! This week, we're going to learn how to manipulate data by filtering to certain participants, selecting specific variables, and creating new variables. 

In addition, we're going to learn how to create figures in R using ggplot2!

1. Watch <a href="https://youtu.be/VUrHP0HPWjc" target="_blank">this video</a>  
2. Download the data that Abigail shared as an attachment in the Week 3 email. 
3. Complete <a href="https://github.com/seegerab/R-workshop/blob/week3_dev/PreWorkshop/Week3/Week3.Rmd" target="_blank">Week2.Rmd</a>

When you first open the .Rmd, you will likely see a prompt at the top to install "tidyverse" and "tableone". You may click "Install", or wait until we learn about these packages further down in the .Rmd and install then. 

4. Fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFl47GV0cpqrnyWu-l2evzrMRAyC2K8T_SRwfNPBf2koswfA/viewform" target="_blank">this survey</a>  

5. Congratulations! You completed week 3.
