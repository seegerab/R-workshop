# Introduction to R and Statistics for the Stool4TB Annual Meeting

This repository contains materials for the *Stool4TB R and Statistics Workshop* (May 2025). You'll find code and data sets to help you get started with R, RStudio, and basic statistical concepts.

**Workshop Dates**: Friday, May 30, 2025  
**Location**: In person - Stool4TB Annual Meeting (Mbabane, Eswatini)   

## Overview

In this workshop, we will introduce participants to:

- **R Programming**: Understanding the basics of R and visualization using RStudio.
- **Basic Statistical Concepts**: Overview of key statistical techniques and how to perform basic analyses in R.
- **Hands-on Exercises**: Practical exercises using Stool4TB data to help reinforce the concepts learned.

## Workshop Materials

The materials for the workshop include:

1. **Code**: R markdown (.Rmd) scripts that demonstrate the key concepts and statistical techniques and includes information on the basics of R programming and introductory statistics.
2. **Datasets**: Data for use during the workshop exercises.

You can find all of the materials in this repository.

### Tools

Throughout the course of the pre-workshop activies, you will install and use the following tools:

- **R**: The programming language we will be using for statistical analysis.
- **RStudio**: A powerful IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for R that makes it easier to write and run R code.

As an analogy, R is the foundation - like a basic text editor. RStudio offers enhanced tools, similar to how Microsoft Word or Google Docs provides more features and tools than a simple text editor.

You will install these tools in week 1 of the pre-workshop activities.
